                            A kickflip is a basic trick in skateboarding where the board rotates 360 degrees on its vertical axis while you're in the air. Here's how to do it:
                        </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                            Start with your back foot on the tail of the skateboard and your front foot near the middle of the board.
                        </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                            Bend your knees and crouch down slightly to prepare for the jump.
                        </p></li>
                    <li> <p>
                            Use your back foot to pop the tail of the skateboard off the ground, while simultaneously jumping into the air.
                        </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                            As the board pops up, use your front foot to scoop the board around in a flicking motion. This will cause the board to rotate in the air.
                        </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                            While the board is rotating, spot your landing and prepare to bend your knees to absorb the impact.
                        </p></li>

                    HOW TO BS TAILSLIDE

                    <li><p>
                           Foot position: Place your back foot in the pocket of the tail, ensuring a good grip and quick scoop for popping high. Your front foot should be situated below the front bolts and angled slightly for backside rotation. 
                            </p></li>
                     <li>
                        <p>
                            Roll up and pop: Approach the obstacle with speed and stay parallel to it. Spot the entry point and crouch to compress. As you get closer, snap the tail on the ground, lift your weight, and pop high enough to get above the obstacle. Start turning your shoulders 90 degrees backside while jumping up.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>
                            Slide: Once your board is above the ledge, turn your hips backside without turning your shoulders as much. Flatten your board and smack the tail on the obstacle to lock into a backside tail slide. Shift your bodyweight on the tail for a proper stance.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>
                            Pop out: At the end of the slide, you can pop out to regular or fakie. To pop out to regular, keep looking over your shoulder while sliding and spot your exit point. To pop out to fakie, keep turning your shoulders backside and look behind you.
                        </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Position your feet: Place the ball of your back foot on the edge of the tail with your toes slightly hanging off the side, and position your front foot somewhere near the center of the board with your toes near the side and pointed toward the nose. Keep your weight evenly distributed on the balls of your feet.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Jump: Perform a solid upwards jump with lateral motion, leaning into the toe side of the deck just before jumping to set yourself up for the trick's direction.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Scoop: Execute a strong inward curling motion with your back ankle, torquing and shoving the tail downwards and backwards towards your heel to spin the board for the 360 rotation. The scoop should also be directed slightly forward towards the nose.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Flick: As you release the scoop, perform a subtle flicking motion with your front foot, kicking out the toes to graze the grip. The flick should be more upwards and about 20-30 degrees to the toe side of the board.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Catch: Gently catch the board with your front foot as it wraps around and hits the underside, or use both feet to stop the rotation.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Practice: Familiarize yourself with the trick's feeling and appearance, and mentally rehearse landing it to build confidence. Use smooth ground, softer surfaces, or wax the tail for easier learning. Remember to have fun and take breaks when needed.
                        </p>
